# `at://` bots

Bots for the `at://` protocol and Bluesky.

## Inspiration

You can [read more about this repo on my blog](https://mykal.codes/posts/bots-on-bluesky). Basically I just wanted an outlet to mess around with bots on Bluesky and this struck me as a remarkably easy pathway to do so.

## Features 

This bot will probably work primarily over PM to reduce feed spam but I'm not against it posting automatically at some point. 

- [x] **Rolls Dice**: will roll dice if you PM it `roll <some-number>`.
- [ ] **TTS Generator**: will generate a TTS audio file of any linked article.
- [ ] **LLM function calling**: instead of key based calling, it may be better to have LLM powered function calling + a more organic chat experience.
